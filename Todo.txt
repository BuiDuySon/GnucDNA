host that asks for alt source is put into map
map<host, vector of sources>
send x-features in upload header


download 
	dont send same hosts in alt loc
	add f2f loc
	add self to f2f loc
	remove push locs

u/l and d/l headers for alt push
dl nexttry limits

keep track of alt-locs already sent to host so they are not repeated
keep push proxies in alt list updated


Upload Header
	X-Features: fwt/1.0, fwalt/0.1 

X-Falt  ...
X-NFalt ...

Alternate location testing on hour

Handshake encode/decode

Stop and Start share file

Support G2 version of push proxy
UPnP

IP Cache sorted by largest difference between (first seen and last seen) minus difference between (current time and last seen)

preference newer versions

digitally signed ban list, public key distributed with client
keep alt hosts for a half hour then kill

Decode / Encode handshakes

Now	
	IPrefs::SetSpeedUp
	IPrefs::SetSpeedDown
	Set upload speed only if uploaded, take other speed stuff out
	
	table % full doesnt get too large
	sending/recving 64kb packets	`


G2 Questions
	closed clusters?
	Kill BE before it gets off ground, bad idea from G1 devs
	Screw bitprints
	Send null qka on qkr to child, signal remove from global cache
	Fixing - network disable still being sent when header is same


Rainy Day
	Unicode / UTF-8 support
	Advanced Query matching
	Advance error logging
	http templates as resources
	Accurate network stats
	Move filters out of dna
	PacketType/Sec using map<CString, int>
	HTTP request Host: without port, read location header for redirect
